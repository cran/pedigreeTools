version 0.1 (2018-11-14)
Initial version of the software

version 0.2 (2019-03-06)
Bug fixes, 
The rchk tool (https://github.com/kalibera/rchk) detected 
a memory protection bug in the file pedigree.c (line 46) that 
was fixed in this version. Only three lines of code were modified:

before:

setAttrib(ans, install("F"), allocVector(REALSXP, n));

now has ben replaced with:

SEXP tmp2 = PROTECT(allocVector(REALSXP, n));
setAttrib(ans, install("F"), tmp2);

and a call to the UNPROTECT() macro was added at the end of the function:

UNPROTECT(1);
return ans;

version 0.3 (2024-10-10)

Fixes the following problems:

1)

Found the following Rd file(s) with Rd \link{} targets missing package anchors:
    getA.Rd: dsCMatrix-class
    getAInv.Rd: dsCMatrix-class
    getASubset.Rd: dsCMatrix-class
    getT.Rd: dtCMatrix-class
    getTInv.Rd: dtCMatrix-class
    relfactor.Rd: dtCMatrix-class
    relfactorInv.Rd: dtCMatrix-class

2)

The *Strict* additional issue.

Compilation fails with _R_USE_STRICT_R_HEADERS_=true, which defines
STRICT_R_HEADERS to 1 which removes

- the legacy definition of PI (use POSIX's M_PI, available in R fer ever).
- the RS.h declarations for Calloc, Realloc, Free (use R_ forms i
  available since R 3.4.0).

The aim is to clean the namespace: in particular having a definition
for Free has conflicted with some packages' C++ code.

It is planned that STRICT_R_HEADERS=1 will become the default for 4.5.0,
which in particular makes it necesssary that all CRAN packages with many
strong reverse dependencies compile/install ok with the new default.
