version 0.1 (2018-11-14)
Initial version of the software

version 0.2 (2019-03-06)
Bug fixes, 
The rchk tool (https://github.com/kalibera/rchk) detected 
a memory protection bug in the file pedigree.c (line 46) that 
was fixed in this version. Only three lines of code were modified:

before:

setAttrib(ans, install("F"), allocVector(REALSXP, n));

now has ben replaced with:

SEXP tmp2 = PROTECT(allocVector(REALSXP, n));
setAttrib(ans, install("F"), tmp2);

and a call to the UNPROTECT() macro was added at the end of the function:

UNPROTECT(1);
return ans;
